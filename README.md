This repository contains two simple web applications:

Music Player: A basic music player that can play, pause, and skip between songs.
Weather App: A simple weather application that fetches and displays weather information based on a user's location or city.
Both apps are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Music Player app uses an array of sample songs, and the Weather app fetches weather data from a public API.
